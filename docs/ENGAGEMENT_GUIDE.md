## Tips for Good Engagement

### Be Respectful
Keep your comments professional and constructive. Remember that colleagues will read what you write.

### Stay On Topic
Comment about the page content. If you have unrelated questions, use other communication channels.

### Be Concise
Short, clear comments are most effective. Get to the point quickly.

### Use Reactions Wisely
A quick emoji reaction can show appreciation without adding to the comment count. Use reactions when you agree but don't have anything new to add.

### Reply Thoughtfully
When replying to someone, make sure you're adding value to the conversation.
